# üîí Security Headers Checker

A simple Python script that checks if a given URL has the important security headers configured properly.

It fetches all HTTP response headers and reports:
- Missing security headers
- Weak security settings (e.g., `Server` header exposed, missing `Secure`/`HttpOnly` on cookies)

---

## üöÄ Features
- Sends a `HEAD` request first (falls back to `GET` if needed)
- Lists **all response headers**
- Checks against a **comprehensive list** of modern security headers
- Gives **warnings** if important flags are missing (e.g., in cookies)
- Helps web developers and security testers quickly audit a website
